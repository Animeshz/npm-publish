## Changelog

### Breaking Changes
N/A

### New Features
* Support for bundling kotlin/js dependencies
* Automatic kotlin/js dependency resolution (including transitive dependencies) and bundling
* New configuration flag (global and on publication) `bundleKotlinDependencies`
 to control the above behaviour (only works for autogenerated kotlin publications)

### Fixes
* packageJson sub-DSLs no longer override existing configs and instead patches on top of them
